This project is based on the guide, [How to Create a Block Explorer with QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/guides/ethereum-development/how-to-create-a-block-explorer-with-quicknode).

## Clone Example Monorepo

To begin, clone the `qn-guide-examples` repo, navigate to this project's directory and open the project directory in a code editor (VS code in this case).

```

Save any PNG format image in the `img` folder and name it **logo.png**.

Open the **explorer.html** file and replace **ADD_YOUR_QUICKNODE_HERE** on [Line 78](https://github.com/quiknode-labs/qn-guide-examples/blob/main/ethereum/explorer/explorer.html#L78) with a [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=githubscaffolds&utm_campaign=explorer_app) Ethereum HTTPS endpoint.
